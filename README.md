#Interactive Solar System
![preview_SolarSystem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emiliano-carrillo/Sistema-solar-Interactivo/master/preview.png)
It is an educational program that teaches young kids the planets that orbit around the sun. 
They can learn things such as the names of the planets, the position and order of them and also their appearence. All of which in spanish so they can also learn the language.

##Things about the program:
- It was built in flash using ActionScript 3.0 as programming language.

##How to use it:
- You have to drag and drop the planet on whichever area you think it may go.
- If you were correct the planet stays in place and displays its name, if you weren't it returns to the pile near the sun.
- Once you fill every whole in the solar system you can push the restart button and play as many times you need to learn them by heart.
- Enjoy!
